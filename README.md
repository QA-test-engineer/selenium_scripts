Selenium is most popular automation tool used for testing web applications. In this repository various advance selenium concepts has implemented with test scripts.

Selenium has following main components:- 

Selenium WebDriver: 
This is the core component of Selenium. WebDriver provides an API for creating and running automation scripts in various programming languages (such as Java, Python, C#, etc.) to interact with web browsers. It directly communicates with the browser using the browser's native support for automation.

Selenium Grid: 
Selenium Grid is a tool used for distributing test scripts across multiple browsers and machines simultaneously, enabling parallel test execution. It allows you to run tests on different browser versions, operating systems, and machines in parallel.

Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment): 
Selenium IDE is a browser extension used for creating simple automation scripts through record and playback functionality. It's particularly useful for quick test script creation and prototyping.

Selenium Client Libraries: 
Selenium provides client libraries for various programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript (Node.js), etc. These client libraries allow you to write automation scripts using Selenium WebDriver API in your preferred programming language.

Browser Drivers: 
Selenium WebDriver requires browser-specific drivers to interact with different web browsers. These drivers act as intermediaries between the WebDriver scripts and the browsers. Each browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) requires its respective driver to be installed and configured.

Browser Compatibility: 
Selenium supports major web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, etc. It allows automation testing on these browsers across different operating systems.

Testing Framework Integration: 
Selenium WebDriver can be integrated with various testing frameworks such as TestNG, JUnit, NUnit, etc., to organize and execute test scripts efficiently, manage dependencies, and generate reports.

Supported Languages and Platforms: 
Selenium supports multiple programming languages like Java, Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. It also runs on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, making it versatile for test automation across various environments.

These components collectively provide a robust framework for automating web application testing and ensuring the quality and reliability of web-based software products.
